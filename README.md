# Sandwich Club Project

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/l/rustc-serialize.svg?maxAge=2592000)]()

This is my version of Udacity's Sandwich Club project. I build this as part of [Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) program i've enrolled.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will complete the **Sandwich Club** app to show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.

## What Will I Learn?
Through this project, you will:
- Learn how to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly
